Over the summer 2021 I had the opportunity to work a lot with Azure's core services when figuring out how best to implement a greenfield project to track tutoring usage for my department.

I am comfortable with many of the fundamentals such as configuring resource groups, deploying web services, hooking up to a CosmosDB instance, and building serverless Azure functions. I have also done some general poking around in the Azure CLI.
