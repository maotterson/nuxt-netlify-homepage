I would consider myself very comfortable with many of the core features of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Access. In working as a tutor I have also been exposed to some lesser-used features of these programs, which at times I have found can be quite interesting.

I have also done some Excel integration with PowerApps for external data transformation, but overall my experience is limited behind the hood when it comes to writing VB/VBA.
