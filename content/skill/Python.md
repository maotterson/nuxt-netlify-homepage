I began using Python before I chose to pursue a career in software development, and am generally most comfortable using it for smaller scale solutions.

My introduction to the language was actually in solving practice bioinformatics algorithms.

I am also generally familiar with the Django framework, and using it for basic tasks like implementing a simple RESTful API.
