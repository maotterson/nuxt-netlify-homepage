I have worked with ASP.NET/.NET Core for several years, as it was the first backend web framework that I was introduced to. 

I have implemented projects using domain-driven design principles and a clean architecture approach eith CQRS using Mediatr. I also have a experience creating APIs using a layered architecture.
