I have worked with ASP.NET for multiple years, as the first web framework that I was introduced to. 

In an academic setting I first began working with **Web Forms**, but with the advent of ASP.NET Core I am now most familiar with **Razor Pages** (MVVM) or **MVC** project paradigms.

ASP.NET Core is currently my preferred *statically-typed* back-end tool, as I have a preference for C#. I have also tutored the subject matter for multiple years.
