My primary expertise lies in the **Laravel** ecosystem. I have a strong command of its core features and have utilized powerful tools like **Inertia.js** for building modern single-page applications, **Sanctum** for API authentication, and **Horizon** for managing queues. I'm also adept at setting up local development environments using **Laravel Sail**. Beyond Laravel, I have experience with vanilla PHP having tutored many students in client-server scripting.
