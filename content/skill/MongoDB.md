Defaulting to Node.js/Express.js, most of the time MongoDB is my database service of choice utilizing the Mongoose module. 

I have also incorporated MongoDB Realm into projects to run scheduled serverless functions to perform tasks like normalizing data from an external source to store more efficiently on my end, for example.
