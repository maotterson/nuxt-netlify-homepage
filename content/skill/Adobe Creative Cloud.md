Much of my experience with the Adobe Creative suite of tools has been to enhance other projects and has been self-taught.

Examples include the creation of simple vector logos using **Illustrator**, and **Photoshop** for miscellaneous tasks.

I have also used **Gimp** and **Inkscape** extensively as open-source alternatives.
