I have had a foundational knowledge of HTML and its general best practices dating back to before my decision to pursue web development as a career.

Notably in recent memory as it pertains to "pure HTML" development, I was tasked with creating a technology guide to be used by my tutor coworkers with Canvas LMS. I was confined in this instance to a simple WYSIWYG editor with a whitelist of **inline**-CSS properties to modify/no JavaScript.
