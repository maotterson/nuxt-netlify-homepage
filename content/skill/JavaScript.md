JavaScript is the language I am most comfortable sitting down and coding in for a given project, as I generally default to utilizing whichever technologies are applicable along the MEVN stack. 

I recognize its shortcomings out-of-the-box, but with any number of *quality-of-life* enhancements along the lines of VS Code extensions/linters I find it very enjoyable to work with.
