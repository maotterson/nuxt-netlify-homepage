I only started working with Go a couple months ago, and the extent of my experience has been basic foundational web-related "stuff", such as creating a REST API with and without a framework (**Gin**).

I anticipate working with it a lot more in the future as I am interested into contributing to some projects with the **CNCF**** in the near future.
