I have *played around with* firestore as a simple backend-as-a-service on small projects, but most of my experience with Google Cloud is through their service APIs. 

I have had experience implementing Google Maps/Places API integration in several projects, and additionally have played around with Sheets APIs and Scripts for some "quality-of-life" type task automation.
