I have some basic experience using the Firebase BaaS platform on small projects, but most of my experience with Google Cloud is through their API services. 

I have had experience implementing **Google Maps/Places API** integration in several projects, and additionally have played around with **Sheets APIs** and **Scripts** for task automation.
