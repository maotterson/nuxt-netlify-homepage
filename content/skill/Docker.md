My Docker experience has consisted mostly of getting containerized applications deployed successfully. At times that has required making slight tweaks to boilerplate dockerfiles, but not really delving into anything too advanced.

Locally I have also experimented with running **Kubernetes** kind clusters in a Docker Desktop environment because I find the technology to be interesting.
