For version control I have used git exclusively, and have what I would best describe as an intermediate understanding of how to best leverage it in a project.

As most of my project experience has been individualized, I have little experience with merge or rebase conflict resolution for example, but I am very comfortable using it for the most frequent developer-oriented tasks.

I also have experience leveraging git as part of a JAMstack markup-storage workflow.
