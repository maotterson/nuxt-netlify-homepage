I generally tend default to Node.js for applications of all types (web back-ends, data scraping, one-off scripts). I have a good level of familiarity with JavaScript ES6 and its nuances, so I find Node.js helps me prototype solutions relatively quickly.

I prefer to use the express.js framework when creating a back-end and am comfortable with the general workflow.
