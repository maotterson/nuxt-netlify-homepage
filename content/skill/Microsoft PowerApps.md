I have experience leveraging **Microsoft Flow/Power Automate** into both webhooks and for the purpose of automating administrative tasks in my role assisting the staff as a tutor.

This has included configuring HTTP responses to return data from shared Outlook calendars, hooking up web APIs to populate tables in shared Excel sheets, etc.
