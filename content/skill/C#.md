Over the past few years, I have primarily focused on C# development, making it my preferred language and ecosystem. I possess extensive experience in working with C# to build robust and scalable applications.

I also have a lot of experience tutoring and mentoring students with C#. I have successfully guided students through various levels of proficiency, covering topics ranging from introductory concepts and object-oriented principles to advanced skills such as building database-backed CRUD applications alongside Microsoft SQL Server.
