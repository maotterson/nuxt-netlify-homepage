## Summary
A working prototype to handle automated student check-ins at Lorain County Community College's Tutoring Center.

## Contents
The project consisted of two web applications: a Node.js REST API and a ASP.NET website. 

Additionally a MongoDB database was provisioned to hold state accessible from the API.

Microsoft PowerAutomate http endpoints were used as triggers, consumed by the REST API, to integrate Microsoft services used by our department (Teams, Outlook Calendar, Excel). 

DigitalOcean web platforms were provisioned to house each web application. MongoDB Atlas was used to house the database.
